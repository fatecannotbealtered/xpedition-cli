"""FCC guard (CLI-SPEC §13): every leaf command declared by `reference` must be
invoked by at least one command-level test in tests/*.py.

The guard enforces the honesty of release_readiness.fcc_status: it runs the
full enumeration only while the tool claims "verified", so the claim cannot be
flipped without the coverage existing. A zero leaf count fails the guard
itself, so a reference schema change cannot silently disarm it.
